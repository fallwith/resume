<h3>Experience</h3>

<h4>SAP / MeLLmo / Roambi</h4>

<p><strong>DevOps team lead</strong><br />
April 2013 - Present<br />
<em>Encinitas, CA</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Lead the DevOps team of 10 developers split between offices in San Diego and Bangalore. Serve in a hybrid capacity switching between Ruby server application development and devops responsibilities for a small start-up acquired by and left largely autonomous away from SAP.</li>
<li>Plan, prioritize, and assign all tasks for the team. Produce trail maps style training documentation and runbook style how-to guides (chiefly in Markdown). Leverage a variety of communication channels to interface with our Bangalore office and SAP&#8217;s Europe based offices. Handle all team member interviewing and new hire onboarding procedures. Take care of all training and mentoring for Ruby, AWS, unix, and SAP specific business logic.</li>
<li>Refactored the primary Rails application to allow for the decoupling of the heavy client app (JavaScript based) and server pieces; freeing the separate client and server dev teams from their lockstep dev cycles. Each team can now iterate idependently without blocking each other and the client team can release more frequent updates without requiring downtime.</li>
<li>Introduced a new build pipeline that leveraegs Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) to &#8220;prebake&#8221; servers with all necessary packages and application code to facilitate the rapid hot / rolling deployment of code releases to cloud environmenets.</li>
<li>Worked with the other server team Rubyists to produce and maintain a series of gems that are leveraged by a slew of microservices.</li>
<li>Work closely with the Java, iOS, Android, Windows, Chrome, and JavaScript dev teams for all internal and cloud based product rollout and resource provisioning needs. Set up automated build and deployment pipelines using Bamboo and a custom developed Ruby based AWS cloud interface.</li>
<li>Led an initiative to migrate from using Chef server with untested, forked community cookbooks to using Chef solo with Berkshelf, ChefSpec, Vagrant, Foodcritic, and Test Kitchen. Each cookbook now has its own test suite based build plan that has taken us from a &#8220;fingers cross&#8221; style of deployment to one based on reliable consistency and confidence.</li>
<li>Produced a flexible cron driven job system for scheduling tasks to be ran using REST endpoints and a plain English language syntax based YAML file (supports &#8220;every hour&#8221; for example). Tasks can be assigned to one or more server type clusters and then executed on either a single node or all nodes within each cluster.</li>
<li>Introduced a &#8220;provisioner&#8221; cloud server type that is controlled via Capistrano over SSH and orchestrates database migrations, rake tasks, and other chores within each VPC environment, allowing for the full advantages of VPC security without sacrificing convenience.</li>
<li>Leveraged the AWS Ruby SDK (both v1 and v2) for exhaustive automation of the company&#8217;s various cloud services based on EC2 instances, AMIs, ELBs, ASGs, S3, ElastiCache, CloudFront, RDS instances, VPC environments, Route 53, CloudWatch, CloudFormation, IAM, SNS, SQS, etc.  </li>
</ul>
