## Experience {#experience}

###  New Relic  
**Lead Software Engineer**  
January 2022 - Present  
*Remote*  

I lead the dev team responsible for New Relic's open source [Ruby APM agent](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent). The agent is distributed as a gem and integrates with customer applications (Rails, Sinatra, Grape, etc.) to provide observability and performance data.

I established a democratically driven set of development best practices for the dev team aimed at providing consistency and objectivity.

I engage with the Ruby community over Discord, GitHub, conferences, etc. to understand their current needs and be proactive in predicting their future needs.

I author internal tools and maintain containers for CI/CD automation, data parsing, and application testing.

I am a very active participant in various contexts involving leadership and engineers to ideate and continually drive customer focused improvements.

<br />

### Salesforce (Trailhead.com)  
**Principal Member of Technical Staff**  
January 2019 - December 2021  
*Remote*  

I founded and lead an internal tools development team focused on developer happiness for around 100 Trailhead engineers. We identified all aspects of the organization's manual CI/CD process and then automated everything with a focus on idempotency.

I designed and developed Ruby CLI and Ruby on Rails web applications while mentoring our devs who were either new to development or Ruby.

I lead Trailhead's DevOps Guild, which played an important role in maintaining Trailhead's organizational independence while also interfacing with Salesforce's broad enterprise offerings.

I drove discussions and ratifications across all engineering teams for development best practices involving collaboration, unit testing, PR reviews, Git usage, etc.

My dev team later interfaced directly with Trailhead's QA and Growth teams to drive automation and engineer happiness in their areas as well.

<br />

### SAP / MeLLmo (startup MeLLmo was acquired by SAP in 2016)
**Senior Ruby Developer**  
April 2013 - January 2019  
*Cardiff-By-The-Sea, CA and then 100% Remote*  

I joined San Diego startup MeLLmo to help them expand their previously on-prem only offerings to include multi-tenant SaaS cloud services. They used Ruby for everything, so I jumped between their DevOps and web development teams to help wherever I could.

Once our cloud services were generally available, I moved on to leading the cloud team of about 14 engineers distributed between San Diego and Bangalore.

We leveraged AWS SDKs to automate a wide variety of DevOps chores. We developed a template based infrastructure-as-code solution that predated similar offerings from CloudFormation and Terraform.

We developed an image building pipeline based on Ansible, Packer, and Docker.

After we were acquired by SAP, I interfaced with their Vancouver based office and ultimately transitioned to a new team in that office as a remote employee.

I authored a suite of Go based AWS Lambda functions, and worked with SAP's Node.js based development framework.

I put together a self-paced training program for all interested devs covering web application development, testing, linting, containers, continuous integration and deployment, and Kubernetes.

<br />

### Sony Computer Entertainment America (SCEA) (PlayStation)   
**Senior Online Engineer**  
June 2008 - March 2013  
*Sorrento Valley, CA*  
 
At Sony I joined a tiny skunkworks team that pioneered the use of Ruby development and cloud services (AWS) to introduce dramatic new possibilities that differed from the company's previous on-prem Java based offerings. Our efforts were hugely successful, and Sony migrated to a mix of OpenStack and AWS cloud offerings based on our proven results.

I did development work to provide 1st and 3rd party PlayStation video game dev teams with server-side functionality related to leaderboards, profiles, chat, game servers, metrics, trophies, and ghost data. I also helped them integrate a client SDK into their games.

We designed and architected cloud topology that allowed systems to handle significant production traffic of 10,000 concurrent requests a second.

I lead efforts to introduce unit testing, client and server environment configuration standardization, and coding guidelines and best practices.

<br />
<br />

### Qualcomm
**Senior Programmer Analyst**  
June 2006 - May 2008  
*Sorrento Valley, CA*  

I was brought to Qualcomm to take over lead development duties on a massively customized Objective Perl based ticket tracking system. We used Ruby for small things and contributed to the company's Java code bases as well. From there I was selected to lead a Python based project tracking system.

<br />

### First American CREDCO
**Systems Engineer**  
June 1997 - June 2006  
*Poway, CA*  

At CREDCO I developed a suite of Perl and Ruby on Rails based web applications for internal developer use and conducted systems engineering efforts that saw me embedded with various teams to observe their processes and collaborate with them on options for increased efficiency and consistency.
