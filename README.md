# resume

This repo is home to my resume in [pdf](james.pdf), [html](james.html), and
[markdown](james.md) formats.  

The pdf and html files were generated from the markdown source using Craig
Davis' [Markdown Resume Generator](https://github.com/there4/markdown-resume).  

To regenerate the pdf and html files:  

1. clone this repo
2. initialize the markdown resume generator submodule
3. run the `pdf` and `html` scripts
